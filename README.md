# Portfolio

Just a simple portfolio for different projects that have been worked on.

[See the live site here](https://tonyneuhold.com/)

## Architecture

There are two versions of this portfolio with some shared code between them. This was mainly done as practice managing a shared codebase with two largely different technologies and as a way to practice deployment for two different projects out of a monorepo. 

- [React portfolio](./react)
- [Svelte portfolio](./svelte)
