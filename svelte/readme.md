# Svelte Portfolio

This is the version of the portfolio written in Svelte. 

## Development

The various package.json commands are below:

* `yarn build` will build the SvelteKit application
* `yarn preview` will preview the built application locally (can use this to do things locally, but still need to find the command to use on netlify)
* `yarn dev` will run the hot-reloading dev version
